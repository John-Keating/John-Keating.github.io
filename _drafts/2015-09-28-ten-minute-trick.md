# A Ten Minute Trick

Well into the evening last Wednesday, the three other team members and I crouched over a screen. I was in the driving seat, meaning I was typing, while the others advised what to do next. After a recent graduate of Metis, who had been working next to us, turned around and asked, 'Do you need some help? Because you've been saying the same things for the past half an hour.' (Thanks! ;) )

He was right. Just as we had wound our data into a Gordian knot we couldn't unpick, our thoughts had become looped and we weren't making any progress. The four of us had been given the task of cleaning and examining the New York Subway Turnstile data. Roughly every four hours each turnstile reports the number of people who had entered and exited. We needed to gather all of these turnstiles and all of these intervals into estimated numbers for the morning, afternoon, and evening traffic of every station. Our team was pretty new to Python and, while I had some experience working in Pandas, the others were more comfortable working with lists and dictionaries. Combining both dictionaries and Pandas dataframes seemed like a good idea (and it can be if you know what your are doing) had left us with clean data we couldn't access.

I learned three things from the experience:

- Take breaks! This is really important. You will do more if you give your mind a rest.

- After a couple of attempts ask for help, don't wait for someone to realize you need it.

- You get better very quickly, especially when you're working in a team.

We did manage to complete the project and you can see it here, which was pretty cool considering it was our first week as apprentice data scientists and the project was given to us with what the instructors termed, 'unfairly short deadlines'. 

The third point,The coolest part, and this is going to sound cheesy because, well it is cheesy, was working with my teammates. Each of us brought their own skills and knowledge, and together we were able to produce something none of could have done a week before. Also, we learned a lot from each other.

The Sunday after the project I set aside four hours to tackle the last few challenges for the week, which are homework exercises. I thought four hours was a fair enough target given how long it took us to do the project. I had coffee brewed and set at it. Ten minutes later, I was done.

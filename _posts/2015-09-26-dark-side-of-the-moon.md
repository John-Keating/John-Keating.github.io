# The Dark Side of Oxford St Station

If you start playing Pink Floyd's [_The Dark Side of the Moon_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon) when the MGM lion roars at the start of the Wizard of Oz, a number of strange coincidents occur between the music and the film. For instance, the good witch of the North appears right when Richard Waters snarls 'don't give me none of that goody-good bullsh\*t. (I am not making this up. You can start your journey down the rabbit hole [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Side_of_the_Rainbow). 

The reservoir of Jungian psycho-cultural meaning not only floods 70's
psychedelic rock, but has also infused the New York Subway turnstile data we
worked on last week. When
I was going through the data, I chose one station to examine in detail no. 300 in my
dataframe, which turned out to be Oxford St. Station on 104 Street. The station
showed a weired spike in the number entries around May 16, 2015. When I broke the entries down by day of the week using Matplotlib, I got this:

When placed next to the album cover of The Dark Side of the Moon, the resemblance is
uncanny.

# Coincidence? 
Yes, it's just coincidence. But it is a good example of how graphing your data
can point out recording errors, which is the most likely explanation for the
sudden spike on Thursdays.

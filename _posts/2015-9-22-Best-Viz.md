title: Best Data Visualization, Ever! 
---
By way of introduction, rather than talk about myself, I want to talk about the my favorite graph. I feel
excited and inspired every time I see it, and I bet you've never seen such an
epic story told so simply or beautifully.

## Minard's Map of Napoleon's Campaign
![alt text](org/wiki/File:Minard_map_of_napoleon.png, 'a modern update and translation of the original')
Charles Joseph Minard (1781-1870) was a French engineer who invented many of the graphical
depictions of data that we use today. In retirement, he drew the visualization
of Napoleon's disastrous Russian campaign of 1812.  I'm not the only one to consider this the
greatest data visualization ever.

Follow the thick gray line,
representing the _Grande Armée_ at it's full strength, as it marches into the Russian
Empire. Napoleon wanted to quickly engage the Tsar's army, wipe them out, and
get out before the winter. The Russians, however, retreated, burning crops and
settlements to deny the Napoleon any supplies. Guerilla tactics and hunger began
to thin the French forces. Finally, Napoleon defeats the Russian army in battle
but arrives to find Moscow burning denying his army shelter for the Russian
winter.

The black line follows the retreat west. The bottom of the graph displays the
freezing winter temperatures. The French forces, low on supplies, harried by
Russian forces, and unprepared for the harsh winter started to die in droves.
Only 10,000 made it out of Russia.

The concision of the visualization is its strength. Minard managed to combine
location, weather, and the size of the army in one picture. The magnitude of
the disaster, the cold, and distance from Moscow are immediately obvious.

And,
perhaps, that's the fault of everyone who has worked in data, statisticians,
econometricians, and so on, who haven't done as good a job as they could at explaining how and
why they work.

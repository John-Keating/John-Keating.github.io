### Who am I?
Hi, I'm John. You've found my blog about becoming and being a data scientist.
I love finding a story in a jumble of information. In another life I was an historian and I hope harness the power of modern statistics to augment the skills I developed studying the past. 
 
If you want to chat about data or anything in the past (preferably 16th and 17th centuries), shoot me an email.

### A note on the images in this blog.
I shamelessly stole the images from the Russian Constructivists. If like them and want to find out more, here's the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(art)) on the movement.

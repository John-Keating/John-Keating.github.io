Hi, I'm John. You've found my blog about becoming and being a data scientist.

### More Information
Apart from being a data scientist, I have a broad range of experience working in different fields and cultures. In another life I was an historian. Building a story from a jumble of information is what drives me.
I've never been attacked by a lion but my brother has.
If you want to chat about data or anything in the past (preferably 16th and 17th centuries), shoot me an email.

### A note on the images in this blog.
I shamelessly stole images from the Russian Constructivists. If like it and want to find out more here's the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(art)) on the movement.

Hi, I'm John. You've found my blog about becoming and being a data scientist.

### More Information
Building a story from a jumble of information is what drives me. In another life I was an historian. I hope to combine the breadth of historical learning with the power of modern data analysis.
 
If you want to chat about data or anything in the past (preferably 16th and 17th centuries), shoot me an email.

### A note on the images in this blog.
I shamelessly stole images from the Russian Constructivists. If like it and want to find out more here's the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(art)) on the movement.
